<p>The library adds websocket support to django (now any wsgi app). It gives event driven websocket control for simple and straight forward programming.</p>
<p>The idea is to create a separate websocket server when an instance of django wsgi application instance is produced. and kill it as soon as the instance dies.</p>

you can now add base websocket url using <code>WEBSOCKET_BASE_URI</code> setting in django&#39;s <code>settings.py</code>.
<em>Breaking Changes</em>
all the websocket classes you want to use have to inherit <code>djwebsockets.websocket.BaseWSClass</code>.</p>
